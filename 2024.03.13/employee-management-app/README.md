# SPA - Context - Sandbox Project

Welcome to the React Context Sandbox project!

The goal of this project is to give you the chance to practice using React's **Context API** by creating your own (small) SPA from scratch, on a theme of your choice!

**You have until 16:00 to get as far as you can with your app.**

You should begin by spending up to 30 minutes planning how your app will be structured and styled, before starting coding. This will save you time later as you will know what you are aiming to create. :smile:

Suggested themes for your app include (but are not limited to):

- A "resum√©" app about yourself
- An app about one of your personal interests
- An app about a famous person or group of people

In your app you **must** use **Context** to pass data at least once (preferably more than once!)

Try to also include as many of the following as you can:

- At least one **state variable** (using the `useState` hook)
- At least 3 "view" components (e.g. "Home", "Contact" etc...)
- A **navigation bar**
- Routing with **React Router**
- A **dynamic** route with a parameter
- At least one example of passing a **prop** from a parent to a child component
- A React **form** (with validation if possible)

Good luck, and have fun. :smile:
