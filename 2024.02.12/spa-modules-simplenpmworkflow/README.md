# Simple NPM and Modules practice

This exercise is about practicing NPM and modules.

## What you will be doing

Your task is to add the missing parts of this project. The regular code is already complete, but somehow the imports and package.json content is missing! 

This is a simple **Node.js** project to demonstrate modules, not a browser project.

## Tasks

### Task 1

- Read the code in `functions.js`, don't edit yet
- Read the code in `main.js`, don't edit yet
- Install `ora` as an npm dependency
- Install `chalk` as an npm dependency
- Configure `package.json` for Node to use ES6 modules

### Task 2

- Only add import/export statements, don't edit the other code
- Add the missing import statements into `main.js`
- Add the missing word "export" `functions.js`
- Try the application, it should run without errors
